# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Overview

## What is AWS IAM?

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. IAM allows you to create and manage AWS users, groups, roles, and define permissions through policies. This ensures that only authorized users and services have access to specific AWS resources.

## IAM Concepts

### 1. **IAM Users**
An **IAM user** is an entity that you create in AWS to represent a person or an application that interacts with AWS. Each user has unique credentials and can be assigned permissions to access AWS resources.

- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Developers accessing AWS resources.
  - Applications interacting with AWS services programmatically.

### 2. **IAM User Groups**
**User groups** are collections of IAM users that you manage as a group. You can assign permissions to a user group, and every user in the group automatically inherits those permissions.

- **Common User Groups**:
  - **Admin Group**: Full access to manage all AWS services.
  - **Development Group**: Permissions to develop and deploy applications.
  - **Operations Group**: Permissions to manage and maintain deployed applications.

### 3. **IAM Roles**
An **IAM role** is similar to a user but without credentials. Roles define permissions and can be assumed by users, applications, or services to interact with AWS resources.

- **Common Role Examples**:
  - **EC2 Role**: Allows an EC2 instance to interact with other AWS services.
  - **Cross-Account Role**: Grants access between two AWS accounts.

### 4. **IAM Policies**
**IAM policies** are JSON documents that define the permissions for an IAM user, group, or role. A policy can grant or deny permissions to perform actions on specific AWS resources.

- **Types of Policies**:
  - **Managed Policies**: AWS provides pre-configured policies to use directly.
  - **Inline Policies**: Custom policies attached to individual users, groups, or roles.

## Best Practices

1. **Use the Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the necessary permissions to users, groups, or roles.
2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security for IAM users.
3. **Rotate Credentials Regularly**: Ensure that passwords and access keys are rotated periodically.
